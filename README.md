# Customer Feedback Analysis

In this project, I have conducted sentiment analysis on customer feedback to extract valuable insights that can enhance products, services, and overall customer experience.

## Description
I utilized various techniques and libraries to preprocess and analyze the feedback data:

- **Libraries Used**: Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, SKlearn.
- **Stemming Technique**: Normalized words into their root forms.
- **Vectorization Technique**: Converted text data into numerical data.
- **Classification Models**: Built and compared the accuracy of the following models:
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Naive Bayes
  - Logistic Regression
  - KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)
  - Decision Tree
  
## Results
Among all the models, Naive Bayes (Bernoulli) achieved the highest accuracy of 77%.

## Improvements
To further enhance this project, potential improvements could include:
- Experimenting with different preprocessing techniques.
- Trying out additional classification algorithms.
- Incorporating more advanced natural language processing (NLP) methods.

Feel free to contribute or provide feedback!
